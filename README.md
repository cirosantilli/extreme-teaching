# Extreme Teaching

Students don't care about you and you feel like crap. Read on.

## The one student motivation: power

Humans have a single motivation in life: **become powerful**.

Convince students that you are making them more powerful, and they will worship you. Fail, and the best you will get from them is pity or fear.

Knowledge gives students two kinds of power:

- **useful**: improve food, housing, health, etc. for others
- **beautiful**: teach others so they feel the beauty

Helping others makes students feel good and get money.

## How to give power optimally

### Don't repeat

Don't repeat what:

- you
- others

have done in the past. Reuse it instead.

Time is precious.

Whenever you repeat you

- waste time
- created a second versions of the information which you have to maintain, correct and improve

How? Use technology to produce, store, transmit and find everything you want to want to teach:

- search for existing teaching material online before creating your own
- write and put it online available to *everyone*, including other teachers
- only answer questions on public forums like Stack Overflow

#### English

Speaking and writing everything in English is a requirement for DRYness.

Why English? Highest speaker GDP, thus more learning material.

If your students don't know English, convince them that what you want to teach them is super cool, only give them English material, and help them learn English.

If you are unable to do that for political reasons, become an English teacher, pro-English activist, or move to an English speaking country. Any other action is a waste of time.

### Text, not video

Use textual materials because they:

- are faster to create and edit
- take up less memory and bandwidth
- are easier to search

### Give freedom

Let your students learn whatever they want, whenever they want.

Why? If you force students to learn only at a given 2 hour interval per week, it is highly likely that this will not be their optimal learning time: They might be not interested or tired at that time.

How? Put the entire course material online open to all forever. This way they can learn before the course has even begun, and after it finished.

#### Give answers

Give students answers to all questions.

Students are capable of not looking if they don't want to. And when they've had enough, then can read answers and understand while the problem is fresh in their minds.

### Talk to individuals

When you get face to face time with students, don't teach.

Every question should be posed online where it can be found later.

The only goal of meeting students is talking to them individually or in small groups to:

- understand what they feel
- transmit your passion for the subject

and letting them do the same amongst themselves.

If you talk to a large group, you will only reach / understand a very small percentage of the group, so your time is wasted.

It is better to deeply understand what 25% of the students feel and adapt the course material than to get a message across to 5% of them.

### Learn by teaching

Incentive students to learn by teaching.

How? Give them the source code for the textbook and tell them to hack away.
